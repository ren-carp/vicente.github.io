<tr>
<td><b>Venus</b></td>
<td>The second closest planet to the sun, Venus is the hottest planet because of its thick atmosphere.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b><b>Water in space</b></b></td>
<td>In 2011, scientists discovered a huge body of water floating in space, which is 140 trillion times the amount of water in all the Earth's oceans.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b><b>Earth's shape</b></b></td>
<td>Earth is not a perfect sphere because it bulges at the equator and flattens at the poles. </td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Neptune's winds</b></td>
<td>Neptune has supersonic winds, with speeds of over 1,100 miles per hour at its highest altitudes.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>The solar system's size</b></td>
<td>The solar system is huge, and NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft became the first human-made object to enter interstellar space in 2012.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Water on the moon</b> </td>
<td>The moon has water in the form of ice trapped in dust and minerals on and under the surface.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>The moon's distance from Earth</b>
</td>
<td>The moon is slowly moving away from Earth, getting about an inch farther away each year.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>The moon's gravity</b></td>
<td>The moon's gravity is only 0.17 times as strong as Earth's gravity.</td></tr>


<tr>
<td><b>The "dark side" of the moon</b></td>
<td> The "dark side" of the moon is a myth; both sides experience the same amount of sunlight, but we only see one side from Earth due to tidal locking.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Tidal pull</b>
</td>
<td>The Moon's gravity causes the tides on Earth, creating bulges of water on the side facing the Moon and the opposite side.</td>
</tr> 

<tr>
<td><b>Slowly drifting away</b></td>
<td>The Moon is gradually moving further away from Earth at a rate of about 3.8cm per year. </td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Moonquakes</b>
</td>
<td>The Moon experiences small "moonquakes" due to the gravitational forces from Earth. </td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>No atmosphere</b>
</td>
<td>The Moon has no atmosphere, meaning there is no air to breathe on its surface. </td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Formation theory</b>
</td>
<td>The prevailing theory is that the Moon formed from debris ejected when a Mars-sized object collided with early Earth.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Largest planet</b>
</td>
<td>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Ringed planet</b>
</td>
<td>Saturn is most famous for its prominent ring system. </td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Hottest planet</b>
</td>
<td>Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system despite not being the closest to the Sun.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Red planet</b>
</td>
<td>Mars is often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance from iron oxide on its surface. </td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Sideways rotation</b>
</td>
<td>Uranus spins on its side, making it appear to rotate sideways compared to other planets.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Great Red Spot</b>
</td>
<td>Jupiter has a massive storm known as the Great Red Spot.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Space</b>
</td>
<td>Light year: A light year is the distance light travels in one year, a unit used to measure vast distances in space.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Black holes</b>
</td>
<td>Black holes are regions in space with such strong gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape. </td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Asteroids</b>
</td>
<td>Asteroids are rocky bodies orbiting the Sun, mostly located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. </td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Comets</b>
</td>
<td>Comets are icy bodies that develop a tail when they get close to the Sun.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Milky Way galaxy</b>
</td>
<td>Our solar system is located within the Milky Way galaxy.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Supernova</b>
</td>
<td>A supernova is a massive explosion of a dying star. </td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Human Space Exploration</b>
</td>
<td>Neil Armstrong was the first human to walk on the Moon. </td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>International Space Station</b>
</td>
<td>The ISS is a research facility orbiting Earth where astronauts from different countries live and work.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Space shuttle</b>
</td>
<td>The Space Shuttle was a reusable spacecraft used for multiple missions to space. </td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Hubble Space Telescope</b>
</td>
<td>The Hubble Telescope is a powerful space telescope that has provided stunning images of the universe.</td></tr>
