<h1>Geology</h1>
<font face="monospace" size="4"><p>
Geology, or <i>geoscience</i>, or <i>earth science</i>, is the scientific study of Earth's structure, composition, and processes. The geologists study:
<ol>
<li> how the earth was formed</li>
<li> the types of rocks that make up the earth
<li> the history of life on earth </li> 
<li> the processes that have shaped the Earth over time </li>
<li> the earth's natural resources, including minerals and energy</li>
</ol>

<b>How geologists study</b><br><ul>
<li>make observations of rocks and their relationships to each other</li>
<li>study fossils</li>
<li>study how rocks have been deformed</li>
<li>study how rocks have been changed by heat and/or pressure</li>
<li>study how tectonic plates move and interact with the mantle</li></ul>

<b>Why study geology?</b><br><ol>
<li>Studying the Earth's structure and processes helps us understand its past and predict its future </li>
<li>Geology has practical applications in engineering, military, and forensic studies </li>
<li>Geology integrates ideas from math, physics, chemistry, and biology </li></ul>

<p>Some topics of Geology: Mineralogy, Stratigraphy, Sedimentology, Paleontology, Igneous geology, Structural geology, Metamorphic geology, and Regional geology.</p>

          <h4>MINERALOGY </h4> 

<p>Mineralogy is the scientific study of minerals, which are inorganic materials that make up the Earth. It includes the study of their composition, structure, and properties. </p>

<h4>STRATIGRAPHY</h4>
<p>Stratigraphy is the study of rock layers, or strata, and the relationships between them. It's a branch of geology that helps us understand the history of the Earth.</p>
</div>

<h4>SEDIMENTOLOGY</h4>
<p>Sedimentology, the study of sedimentary rocks and the processes by which they are formed, includes and is related to a large number of phenomena. Sedimentology includes the five fundamental processes defined by the term sediaentation --weathering, erosion, transportation, deposition and diagenesis.
